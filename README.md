R package to make clean and customizable SVG figures

# Goal
R already has the ability to transform any visual into SVG format.
However, this automated transformation does not allow easy customization of aesthetics.
Our goal is to build SVG templates for each typical statistical visual in which a front-end developer can work with in CSS or Javascript
